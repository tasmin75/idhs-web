## Tech Stack:

Redoak is built using the following technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates efficient rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs. It allows for rapid styling with pre-defined utility classes.
- **React Icons:** A library containing popular icon packs for React projects. It simplifies the integration of icons into the application.
- **Redux Toolkit:** A package that simplifies Redux usage by providing utilities to reduce boilerplate code. It enhances the developer experience when managing application state.
- **Materil-UI** Incorporating Material-UI into the Redoak project can enhance the user interface and provide a consistent design language. Here are some potential use cases for Material-UI within the project:

1. Navigation Components: Utilize Material-UI's AppBar, Drawer, and NavigationRail components to design a cohesive navigation system. These components can help create a responsive and intuitive navigation experience, aligning with Material Design principles.

2. Form Elements: Implement Material-UI's TextField, Select, and Autocomplete components to design forms for user input. These components offer built-in validation and styling options, improving the usability and accessibility of form elements within the application.

3. Buttons and Icons: Enhance the visual appeal of buttons and icons using Material-UI's Button and Icon components. These components provide various customization options, such as size, color, and shape, allowing for consistent styling across the application.

4. Snackbar Notifications: Implement Material-UI's Snackbar component to display notifications or alerts to users. Snackbar notifications can be used to provide feedback on user actions, such as successful task creation or error messages.

5. Dialogs and Modals: Use Material-UI's Dialog and Modal components to create pop-up dialogs for interactions such as confirming actions or displaying additional information. These components offer customizable styling and animations, improving the user experience when interacting with modal content.

6. Data Display Components: Utilize Material-UI's Table, Card, and List components to present data in a structured and visually appealing manner. These components provide options for sorting, filtering, and pagination, enhancing the usability of data display within the application.

7. Theme Customization: Leverage Material-UI's theming capabilities to customize the application's color palette, typography, and other design elements. This allows for consistent branding and a cohesive visual identity throughout the application.
